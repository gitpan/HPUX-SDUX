HPUX/SDUX version 0.03
======================

HPUX::SDUX is a Perl module that will help you manage non-standard
Perl modules via SD-UX on HP-UX.  As such, it is useful only for
HP-UX users.

INSTALLATION

To put HPUX::SDUX under SD-UX control:
	make -f sdux_make

This makefile invokes 'swpackage' and 'swinstall', so you need certain
privileges to use it.

To do simple CPAN-style install:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


DEPENDENCIES

All modules that HPUX::SDUX uses are standard as of Perl 5.6.1, perhaps
earlier.  If you find this to be incorrect, please contact the author.

BASIC USAGE

Download a module from CPAN, expand the tarball, move to the expanded
directory, and then
	perl -MHPUX::SDUX -e wmf
	make
	make test
	make depot
	swinstall -s $PWD/sdux -x write_remote_files=true

KNOWN ISSUES

HPUX::SDUX has been tested only with very simple CPAN modules.  It may not
work correctly with complicated ones, such as those that require XS
extensions and those that have complex Makefile.PL's.

The resulting depot in ./sdux is not distributable.  

HPUX::SDUX depends on ExtUtils::MakeMaker, which is reported to be replaced
by Module::Build.  Module::Build compatibility should be added in a future
release of HPUX::SDUX.
